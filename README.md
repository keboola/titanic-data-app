# Titanic Demo Data App
Take a look at our demo data app to see how to create a data app from a Streamlit Python code and how to incorporate data and files from input mapping into your code. This data app allows users to explore and analyze the Titanic dataset using interactive visualizations and filters. 

Here is a brief description of what it does: It reads a CSV file containing the Titanic dataset, displays the app title, logo, and statistics subheader, calculates various metrics such as the total number of people, total women, total men, average age, etc., displays the metrics along with corresponding icons in three columns, provides filters for gender and survival status to refine the data, displays a double-ended slider for filtering the data based on age range, shows a data table with selected columns and allows pagination and sorting, displays two charts - a bar chart showing the number of survivors within different age categories and a bar chart showing the probability of survival by age categories, provides a tab for displaying the raw data table, includes a description section with information about filters and metrics, and shows the creation date and a logo image at the bottom of the page.
